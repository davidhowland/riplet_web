        <p>Welcome to Riplet ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our Riplet iOS application ("App").</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> Riplet collects location data only when you explicitly choose to add a location or record a visit. The app requires location permissions to show your current location on the map and to allow you to select locations to save, but it does not track your location in the background.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Visit Information:</strong> When you add a visit to a location, we store the information you provide, such as the date, time, and any notes you add about your visit.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Categories:</strong> We store any custom categories you create to organize your locations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any other information you voluntarily provide within the app, such as location names and notes.</p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide the core functionality of the Riplet app, allowing you to track and visualize places you've visited</li>
            <li>Display your saved locations and visits on maps</li>
            <li>Generate statistics about your visits</li>
            <li>Sync your data across your devices through iCloud, if you have enabled iCloud syncing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Data Storage and Sync</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your location and visit data is primarily stored locally on your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you have enabled iCloud on your device, your data will be synchronized across your devices using Apple's CloudKit. This data is stored in your private CloudKit database, which is associated with your Apple ID. We do not have access to this data.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described in the Third-Party Services section below. Your data is stored either locally on your device or in your private iCloud account.</p>
        
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</p>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <p>Riplet uses the following services provided by Apple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple MapKit for map visualization</li>
            <li>CoreLocation for geocoding and location services</li>
            <li>CloudKit for data synchronization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These services are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a>.</p>

        <p>Riplet also uses <strong>TerrainTap</strong>, a third-party service, to retrieve elevation data. When you request elevation data for a saved location, the app sends the latitude and longitude coordinates of that location to TerrainTap. These coordinates correspond to a saved location you have chosen and may or may not be your current physical location. No other personally identifiable information is included in these requests. Please refer to TerrainTap's privacy policy for details on how they handle this data.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
        
        <p>However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access the personal information we have about you</li>
            <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate data</li>
            <li>The right to request deletion of your data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account, you can exercise these rights directly by deleting data within the app or uninstalling the app.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Elevation Data</h2>

        <p>Riplet uses TerrainTap to retrieve elevation data for your saved locations. When elevation data is requested, the app sends the latitude and longitude coordinates of the chosen saved location to TerrainTap. These coordinates reflect the saved location you have selected and may or may not correspond to your current physical location. No personally identifiable information is sent with these requests.</p>
