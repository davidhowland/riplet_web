    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 17, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to Riplet. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Riplet mobile application ("App") operated by Frigid Light, LLC ("we," "us," or "our").

    <p><strong>Data Storage:</strong> The App stores your location and visit data on your device and, if enabled, syncs with your personal iCloud account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your data.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain all rights to the data you input into the App. By using the App, you grant us a license to use, store, and process this data solely for the purpose of providing the App's services to you.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Apple App Store Terms</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms are between you and Frigid Light, LLC, not with Apple. Apple is not responsible for the App and its content. However, you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These Terms do not conflict with the App Store Terms of Service</li>

        <li>Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims related to the App</li>
        <li>In the event of a third-party claim that the App infringes intellectual property rights, Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    
    <p>The App, including its content, features, and functionality, is owned by Frigid Light, LLC and is protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>

    <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that any content within the App is accurate, reliable, current, or complete. Results that may be obtained from the use of the App (including location data and elevation information) are used at your discretion and risk.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    
    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL FRIGID LIGHT, LLC, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APP; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE APP; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
    
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Frigid Light, LLC, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your breach of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>The App uses Apple services such as MapKit, CoreLocation, and CloudKit. Your use of these services is subject to Apple's terms and conditions. The App also uses the Open-Elevation API to retrieve elevation data for locations. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party services.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    
    <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
    
    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>
    
    <h2>12. Severability</h2>
    
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>

    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our App and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the App.</p>
